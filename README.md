ACTIVITY 4

1.I implemented event handling by using the setOnClickListener for the button. When I clicked it, the app read the input and showed the result in the TextView.

2.To make the interaction smooth, I used a Toast message to show feedback and added simple validation so the app doesnâ€™t crash when fields are empty.

3.For future versions, I would improve it by adding more input fields, better design, and maybe error highlights to make it look more like a real app.
